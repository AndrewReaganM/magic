## Developing/Deploying Java for AppEngine
The Google AppEngine plugin for Eclipse allows you to create appengine projects, test on a local appengine, and deploy to the cloud.

### Setting up Eclipse
To setup Eclipse for developing for AppEngine, refer to the following instructions provided by Google https://cloud.google.com/eclipse/docs/quickstart

### Creating the Project
A sample Hello World project can be created by following the instructions here: https://cloud.google.com/eclipse/docs/creating-new-webapp
Further development steps can be found in the pages that follow.

### Using Our Java AppEngine Project
After cloning the repository, set the root of the repo as the workspace for Eclipse. The project should be available to work with.

### Testing on a Local AppEngine
Once you have created a sample project or cloned ours, you can run the project in Eclipse. You will have the option to use a server or run on appengine. Select Run on AppEngine to run the program on a local appengine (running from your device). Eclipse will launch a built-in webbrowser to the homepage. You can copy the web address and use it in your browser of choice.

### Deploying to AppEngine
Follow the steps at https://cloud.google.com/eclipse/docs/deploying for deploying to a standard appengine
